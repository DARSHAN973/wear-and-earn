2. ‚úÖ Train admin users on new dashboard features
3. ‚úÖ Set up the weekly cron job for installments
4. ‚úÖ Configure withdrawal approval workflow
5. ‚úÖ Monitor system performance and user feedback

The new Pool-Based MLM System is now live and ready for production use! üöÄ

1. Product & MLM Price

Each product has:

productPrice ‚Üí the normal cost of the item.

mlmPrice ‚Üí extra amount defined by Admin for MLM logic.

User sees totalPrice = productPrice + mlmPrice.

All MLM earnings and pool logic only apply to mlmPrice.

2. First Purchase Flow

When a user makes their first purchase:

Split mlmPrice into Company Share (30%) and Pool Share (70%).

From Pool Share:

20% reserved as self income for the buyer.

Released in 4 equal weekly installments via a cron job.

Remaining 80% added into the Turnover Pool (global pool).

User‚Äôs referral code is only unlocked after their first purchase.

3. Repurchase Flow

On repurchases:

30% company share, 70% pool share.

100% of pool share goes directly to the Turnover Pool.

No self income is given.

4. Referral & Team Formation

Each user can refer unlimited people (no 3√ó3 restriction).

A team is formed when 3 referrals of a user complete their first purchase.

Teams also cascade upward:

If C forms a team, it also counts for their sponsor B, and B‚Äôs sponsor A, etc.

Teams accumulate, and are used for level promotions.

5. Level Promotions

Level is based on total teams formed (direct + cascaded):

L1: 1 team ‚Üí user enters L1 pool.

L2: 9 teams ‚Üí promoted to L2 pool.

L3: 27 teams ‚Üí promoted to L3 pool.

L4: 81 teams ‚Üí promoted to L4 pool.

L5: 243 teams ‚Üí promoted to L5 pool.

Once promoted, user leaves the old level and stays permanently in the higher level.

6. Turnover Pool & Distribution

The Turnover Pool is split at distribution:

L1 = 30%

L2 = 20%

L3 = 20%

L4 = 15%

L5 = 15%

If no users exist in a level, that share goes back to the company.

Within each level, the share is divided equally among all users at that level.

Distribution is triggered manually by Admin, not automatically monthly.

7. Wallet & Withdrawals

All earnings (self income installments + pool distribution) are credited into the wallet table.

Users can withdraw only if:

Wallet balance ‚â• ‚Çπ300.

KYC is approved.

Withdrawals require Admin approval before payout.

8. Admin Controls

Add products (set productPrice + mlmPrice).

Trigger pool distribution anytime.

Approve/reject withdrawals.

View pool balance, user levels, and logs.

9. Edge Cases

Refunds: Reverse self income and pool contributions.

No KYC: Earnings stay in wallet but withdrawal is blocked.

Permanent Levels: Once a level is achieved, it cannot be lost.

Inactive Users: No impact, since system is wild (no fixed slots).
